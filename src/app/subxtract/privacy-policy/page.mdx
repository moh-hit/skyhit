# Privacy Policy - Subxtract

_Last Updated: May 04, 2025_

## Introduction

Welcome to Subscription Tracker ("we," "our," or "us"). We understand that privacy is important to you, and we are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how your information is collected, used, and disclosed when you use our Subscription Tracker application ("App").

## Summary

- Our App operates primarily **offline** and stores all of your subscription data **locally on your device**
- We do not collect, store, or transmit your subscription information to any external servers
- No advertising or third-party analytics are implemented without consent
- You maintain complete control of your data

## Information Collection and Use

### Information You Provide

Our App collects the following information that you manually enter:

- Subscription service names
- Payment amounts
- Billing cycles
- Renewal dates
- Payment methods
- Related subscription notes

### Local Storage

**All data entered into the App is stored locally on your device.** We do not collect, transmit, or store any of your subscription information on external servers or in the cloud. Your information remains exclusively on your device unless you explicitly choose to export or back up your data using the device's built-in sharing mechanisms.

### Authentication

We use **Google Sign-In** to help you authenticate securely. When you sign in, we only request basic profile information necessary for account identification.

For more information about Google's data practices, visit [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

### Analytics

We use **Mixpanel** to understand how the app is used and to improve the overall experience. No subscription data or personal payment details are sent to Mixpanel. Users can disable Mixpanel tracking from the app settings at any time.

### Crash Reporting

Currently, the App does not use any crash reporting tools. If this changes in future versions, the policy will be updated accordingly.

## Data Retention and Deletion

Since all data is stored locally on your device, you maintain complete control over your information. You can delete any or all of your subscription data at any time through the App's interface. When you uninstall the App, all associated data is removed from your device (unless you've created external backups).

## Future Data Sync (Optional)

In future updates, you may have the option to sync your data securely across devices. This feature will be strictly opt-in and will include transparent data handling policies.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top.

## Your Rights

As all data is stored locally on your device and controlled by you, you have full rights to:

- Access your information
- Correct your information
- Delete your information
- Export your information
- Disable analytics tracking
