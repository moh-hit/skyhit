I’ve always hated this. But there’s no better way to do this. It’s a necessary evil. Right..? Well, I’ve recently been coding a lot in Go. And Go does not have `async` and `await`. And this is despite it being famous for its concurrency. And you know what? I really like it.

This is because I make an RSS reader Stratum (iOS, Android) that fetches a lot of RSS feeds. And it turns out sites don’t like it if you spam their site with requests. They will rate limit you. So I decided to add a one second delay between requests. How do you do this? It’s as simple as:
