Managing your monthly subscriptions shouldn’t be a mess of reminders and scattered notes. That's the idea behind **SubXtract** — a thoughtfully designed subscription tracking app that helps users keep track of their recurring expenses in one simple place.

But behind the clean UI and user-friendly design lies a robust offline-first tech stack, built to ensure performance, reliability, and a delightful experience even without internet.

In this post, I’ll walk you through **what SubXtract is**, **what tech powers it**, and **how I implemented key features using Expo, Zustand, MMKV, and Reanimated**.

---

## 🧹 What is SubXtract?

**SubXtract** helps users:

- Track recurring subscriptions like Netflix, Spotify, Rent, etc.
- Add billing details like start date, cycle (monthly, yearly, etc.), and custom notes
- Set preferred currency and theme
- Toggle auto-renew status
- Archive old/canceled subscriptions
- Get notified about upcoming payments
- Use the app completely offline

With an elegant UI and local-first architecture, SubXtract focuses on **privacy, speed, and user control**.

## 🛠️ The Tech Stack

### ⚡ Expo

SubXtract is built with [**Expo**](https://expo.dev) for rapid development, native APIs out of the box, and easy deployment. I used the **Bare workflow** when necessary, especially for MMKV and notification features.

Why Expo?

- Fast iteration cycle
- OTA updates
- Great community ecosystem

### 📦 Zustand + MMKV for Local-First State Management

SubXtract stores all user data locally on the device using a combination of **Zustand** (for state management) and **MMKV** (for super fast key-value storage).

#### 🔐 Setting up MMKV

```tsx
// storage.ts
import { MMKV } from "react-native-mmkv"

export const storage = new MMKV()
```

#### 🧠 Zustand with Persistence Middleware

```tsx
import { create } from "zustand"
import { persist } from "zustand/middleware"
import { storage } from "./storage"

export const useSubscriptionStore = create(
  persist(
    (set) => ({
      subscriptions: [],
      addSubscription: (sub) =>
        set((state) => ({
          subscriptions: [...state.subscriptions, sub],
        })),
      toggleRenewal: (id) =>
        set((state) => ({
          subscriptions: state.subscriptions.map((s) =>
            s.id === id ? { ...s, autoRenew: !s.autoRenew } : s
          ),
        })),
      archiveSubscription: (id) =>
        set((state) => ({
          subscriptions: state.subscriptions.map((s) =>
            s.id === id ? { ...s, archived: true } : s
          ),
        })),
    }),
    {
      name: "subxtract-store",
      storage: {
        getItem: storage.getString.bind(storage),
        setItem: storage.set.bind(storage),
        removeItem: storage.delete.bind(storage),
      },
    }
  )
)
```

This setup ensures lightning-fast access to your app's state, even when offline.

### 🎭 Reanimated for Smooth Animations

To give users a fluid and polished experience, I used **React Native Reanimated** for subtle animations across components like the add/edit modal, theme transitions, and button presses.

#### 🎮 Simple Reanimated Example

```tsx
import Animated, {
  useSharedValue,
  withSpring,
  useAnimatedStyle,
} from "react-native-reanimated"

const offset = useSharedValue(0)

const animatedStyle = useAnimatedStyle(() => {
  return {
    transform: [{ translateY: withSpring(offset.value) }],
  }
})
```

---

## 🌈 Custom Theming

Users can select between light, dark, or system themes. A Zustand store syncs the selected theme across the app, and I use context + MMKV to persist it.

```tsx
export const useThemeStore = create(
  persist(
    (set) => ({
      theme: "system",
      setTheme: (theme) => set({ theme }),
    }),
    {
      name: "theme-settings",
      storage: {
        getItem: storage.getString.bind(storage),
        setItem: storage.set.bind(storage),
        removeItem: storage.delete.bind(storage),
      },
    }
  )
)
```

## 🔔 Local Notifications

SubXtract notifies users about **upcoming payments** based on their billing cycle. This is implemented using Expo Notifications and scheduled jobs at the time of adding a subscription.
